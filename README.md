# Remote Code Execution in Game Development Ecosystems

We demonstrate a novel class of Software Supply Chain (SSC) attacks targeting Real-Time 3D Engines (RT3DEs) like Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot. By exploiting the "Implicit Overridable Hooks" (IMPs) inherent to asset import and build pipelines, we show how adversaries can achieve zero-interaction Code Execution on developer machines and propagate malware to end-users across Desktop, Mobile, and VR platforms.

# ⚠️ Private Repository & Safety Warning
This is a private repository. The Proof-of-Concept (PoC) attack scripts and weaponized payloads stored here are not for public distribution and must remain confidential to uphold ethical research standards.
For Researchers: We are happy to share the complete artifacts with verified academic researchers and industry practitioners for educational and defensive purposes over private channels such as email.

# 🛑 BEWARE: Live Exploitation Material
Authorized users of this repository must exercise extreme caution. This repository contains actual exploitation scripts and malware samples capable of compromising systems, establishing reverse shells, and executing arbitrary code.

DO NOT run these scripts on personal devices, production networks, or enterprise environments.

DO NOT upload these files to public scanners (e.g., VirusTotal) or shared repositories.

ALWAYS execute payloads inside a strictly isolated, sandboxed testbed (e.g., disconnected VMs)
