# Remote Code Execution in Game Development Ecosystems

We demonstrate a novel class of Software Supply Chain (SSC) attacks targeting Real-Time 3D Engines (RT3DEs) like Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot. By exploiting the "Implicit Overridable Hooks" (IMPs) inherent to asset import and build pipelines, we show how adversaries can achieve zero-interaction Code Execution on developer machines and propagate malware to end-users across Desktop, Mobile, and VR platforms.
