# Remote Code Execution in Game Development Ecosystems

We demonstrate a novel class of Software Supply Chain (SSC) attacks targeting Real-Time 3D Engines (RT3DEs) like Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot. By exploiting the "Implicit Overridable Hooks" (IMPs) inherent to asset import and build pipelines, we show how adversaries can achieve zero-interaction Code Execution on developer machines and propagate malware to end-users across Desktop, Mobile, and VR platforms.

## 🔒 Code Availability & Ethics

This repository contains the analysis tools (Algorithm 1) used in our paper.

To uphold ethical research standards and prevent potential misuse, the full offensive source code (PoC attack scripts) is not publicly available. We are committed to responsible disclosure and the safety of the game development ecosystem.

For Researchers: We are happy to share the complete artifacts with verified academic researchers and industry practitioners for educational and defensive purposes. Please contact us at [Your Email/Lab Email] with your institutional affiliation to request access.
